Dear Participant,
 
You are invited to participate in the fourth annual Julia User and Developer survey.
The results of this survey will be presented at JuliaCon 2023 this summer and will
also be made publicly available online. The survey is developed, administered
and analyzed by JuliaHub with input from the Julia community.
We value your time and appreciate your participation. This survey consists of approximately 40 questions and is expected to take no
more than 10-15 minutes to complete.

Thanks to Roger Luo for building JuliaSurveyForm.jl, and thank you to all of our translators for translations.

Your participation is voluntary and anonymous and no personal information will ever be shared.

Please feel free to forward to colleagues and friends who are Julia users.

Thank you for your participation!

Sincerely,

Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral Shah and Alan Edelman
Julia Co-Creators
